Half-baked Kathmandu protocol snapshot, second edition. The real one will come later. PLEASE DO NOT INJECT.

There is no Octez release for this second instance of Kathmandunet. You need to build or grab a build or container from the master branch of Octez built on or after TBD

But the protocol is already snapshotted. The baker binary for this protocol is `tezos-baker-014-PtKathma`. Do not run the "alpha" baker, it will not work.
