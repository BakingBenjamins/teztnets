Half-baked Kathmandu protocol snapshot. The real one will come later. PLEASE DO NOT INJECT.

There is no Octez release for this first instance of Kathmandunet. You need to build or grab a build or container from the master branch of Octez.

Kathmandunet will run Jakarta for the first 2 cycles and then update to Kathmandu. You need to run baking daemons for both protocols at first.
